A bot to randomly publish excerpts from books. 
Goodfellas your time isn't over!

It publishes one tweet every 12 hours. To lookup for those tweets, it goes inside the `dir_to_lookup`. Then opens the file: `files_to_lookup.txt` to randomly choose a book. Afterwards it opens the corresponding book-file, randomly chooses an excerpt: Publish it!

Someday I would like to improve it to a spaced repetition bot.

Right now, it is posting from my account: [nishantiam](https://twitter.com/nishantiam)

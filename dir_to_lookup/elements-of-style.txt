Elements of Style

▪ Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all sentences short or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.

▪ "this is a subject that," reducing it to "this subject," a saving of three words.

▪ trim "used for fuel purposes" down to "used for fuel."

▪ they say "the question as to whether" and that they should just say "whether" — a saving of four words out of a possible five.

▪ 1. Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's.

▪ 2. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last. Thus write, red, white, and blue gold, silver, or copper

▪ 2. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.

▪ 1. Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's. Follow this rule whatever the final consonant. Thus write, Charles's friend

▪ A name or a title in direct address is parenthetic. If, Sir, you refuse, I cannot predict what will happen. Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in.

▪ 3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas. The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.

▪ 3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.

▪ My cousin Bob is a talented harpist, (restrictive) Our oldest daughter, Mary, sings, (nonrestrictive)

▪ Nether Stowey, where Coleridge wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, is a few miles from Bridgewater. In these sentences, the clauses introduced by which, when, and where are nonrestrictive; they do not limit or define, they merely add something

▪ Restrictive clauses, by contrast, are not parenthetic and are not set off by commas. Thus, People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

▪ When the main clause of a sentence is preceded by a phrase or a subordinate clause, use a comma to set off these elements. Partly by hard fighting, partly by diplomatic skill, they enlarged their dominions to the east and rose to royal rank with the possession of Sicily.

▪ 4. Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause. The early records of the city have disappeared, and the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.

▪ 5. Do not join independent clauses with a comma

▪ 6. Do not break sentences in two. In other words, do not use periods for commas. I met them on a Cunard liner many years ago. Coming home from Liverpool to New York. She was an interesting talker. A woman who had traveled all over the world and lived in half a dozen countries. In both these examples, the first period should be replaced by a comma and the following word begun with a small letter.

▪ 7. Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list of particulars, an appositive, an amplification, or an illustrative quotation.

▪ 8. Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption and to announce a long appositive or summary. A dash is a mark of separation stronger than a comma, less formal than a colon, and more relaxed than parentheses. His first thought on getting out of bed — if he had any thought at all — was to get back in again. The rear axle began to make a noise — a grinding, chattering, teeth-gritting rasp.

▪ But certain compounds, often cliches, are so inseparable they are considered a unit and so take a singular verb, as do compound subjects qualified by each or every. The long and the short of it is ... Bread and butter was all she served. Give and take is essential to a happy household. Every window, picture, and mirror was smashed.

▪ Use a singular verb form after each, either, everyone, everybody, neither, nobody, someone. Everybody thinks he has a unique sense of humor. Although both clocks strike cheerfully, neither keeps good time.

▪ A singular subject remains singular even if other nouns are connected to it by with, as well as, in addition to, except, together with, and no less than. His speech as well as his manner is objectionable.

▪ Some nouns that appear to be plural are usually construed as singular and given a singular verb. Politics is an art, not a science. The Republican Headquarters is on this side of the tracks. But The general's quarters are across the river.

▪ 11. A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject. Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two children. The word walking refers to the subject of the sentence, not to the woman.

▪ As a rule, begin each paragraph either with a sentence that suggests the topic or with a sentence that helps the transition

▪ Enormous blocks of print look formidable to readers, who are often reluctant to tackle them. Therefore, breaking long paragraphs in two, even if it is not necessary to do so for sense, meaning, or logical development, is often a visual help. But remember, too, that firing off many short paragraphs in quick succession can be distracting

▪ 14. Use the active voice. The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive: I shall always remember my first visit to Boston. This is much better than My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.

▪ kind. Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made lively and emphatic by substituting a transitive in the active voice for some such perfunctory expression as there is or could be heard. There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground. Dead leaves covered the ground.

▪ 15. Put statements in positive form. Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, noncommittal language. Use the word not as a means of denial or in antithesis, never as a means of evasion. He was not very often on time. He usually came late.

▪ 15. Put statements in positive form. Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, noncommittal language. Use the word not as a means of denial or in antithesis, never as a means of evasion. He was not very often on time. He usually came late. She did not think that studying Latin was a sensible way to use one's time. She thought the study of Latin a waste of time. The Taming of the Shrew is rather weak in spots. Shakespeare does not portray Katharine as a very admirable character, nor does Bianca remain long in memory as an important character in Shakespeare's works. The women in The Taming of the Shrew are unattractive. Katharine is disagreeable, Bianca insignificant.

▪ The Taming of the Shrew is rather weak in spots. Shakespeare does not portray Katharine as a very admirable character, nor does Bianca remain long in memory as an important character in Shakespeare's works. The women in The Taming of the Shrew are unattractive. Katharine is disagreeable, Bianca insignificant. The last example, before correction, is indefinite as well as negative. The corrected version, consequently, is simply a guess at the writer's intention.

▪ Plath may be ranked among those modem poets who died young. Plath was one of those modern poets who died young. If your every sentence admits a doubt, your writing will lack authority. Save the auxiliaries would, should, could, may, might, and can for situations involving real uncertainty.

▪ in spring, summer, or in winter in spring, summer, or winter (in spring, in summer, or in winter)

▪ The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not, as a rule, be separated by a phrase or clause that can be transferred to the beginning. Toni Morrison, in Beloved, writes about characters who have escaped from slavery but are haunted by its heritage. In Beloved, Toni Morrison writes about characters who have escaped from slavery but are haunted by its heritage.

▪ , as in summarizing an essay or reporting a speech, do not overwork such expressions as "he said," "she stated," "the speaker added," "the speaker then went on to say," "the author also thinks."

▪ In summarizing the action of a drama, use the present tense. In summarizing a poem, story, or novel, also use the present, though you may use the past if it seems more natural to do so. If the summary is in the present tense, antecedent action should be expressed by the perfect; if in the past, by the past perfect

▪ The other prominent position in the sentence is the beginning. Any element in the sentence other than the subject becomes emphatic when placed first. Deceit or treachery she could never forgive.

▪ The proper place in the sentence for the word or group of words that the writer desires to make most prominent is usually the end. Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways. Since that time, humanity has advanced in many ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude.

▪ Do not attempt to emphasize simple statements by using a mark of exclamation. It was a wonderful show! It was a wonderful show.

▪ Do not spell out dates or other serial numbers. Write them in figures or in Roman notation, as appropriate.

▪ When two or more words are combined to form a compound adjective, a hyphen is usually required. "He belonged to the leisure class and enjoyed leisure-class pursuits." "She entered her boat in the round-the-island race."

▪ Do not use a hyphen between words that can better be written as one word: water-fowl, waterfowl

▪ Do not spell out dates or other serial numbers. Write them in figures or in Roman notation, as appropriate. August 9, 1988 Part XII Rule 3 352d Infantry Exception: When they occur in dialogue, most dates and numbers are best spelled out. "I arrived home on August ninth."

▪ A sentence containing an expression in parentheses is punctuated outside the last mark of parenthesis exactly as if the parenthetical expression were absent. The expression within the marks is punctuated as if it stood by itself, except that the final stop is omitted unless it is a question mark or an exclamation point.

▪ Quotations introduced by that are indirect discourse and not enclosed in quotation marks. Keats declares that beauty is truth, truth beauty.

▪ Allusion. Easily confused with illusion. The first means "an indirect reference"; the second means "an unreal image" or "a false impression."

▪ My brother anticipated the upturn in the market. My brother expected the upturn in the market. In the second example, the word anticipated is ambiguous. It could mean simply that the brother believed the upturn would occur, or it could mean that he acted in advance of the expected upturn — by buying stock, perhaps.

▪ The too-frequent use of but as a conjunction leads to the fault discussed under Rule 18. A loose sentence formed with but can usually be converted into a periodic sentence formed with although.

▪ Paris has been compared to ancient Athens; it may be compared with modern London.

▪ The dismissive "I couldn't care less" is often used with the shortened "not" mistakenly (and mysteriously) omitted: "I could care less."

▪ Effect. As a noun, means "result"; as a verb, means "to bring about," "to accomplish" (not to be confused with affect, which means "to influence").

▪ To say, "Hopefully I'll leave on the noon plane" is to talk nonsense. Do you mean you'll leave on the noon plane in a hopeful frame of mind? Or do you mean you hope you'll leave on the noon plane? Whichever you mean, you haven't said it clearly

▪ Irregardless. Should be regardless. The error results from failure to see the negative in -less

▪ Leave. Not to be misused for let. Leave it stand the way it is. Let it stand the way it is.

▪ Less refers to quantity, fewer to number. "His troubles are less than mine" means "His troubles are not so great as mine." "His troubles are fewer than mine" means "His troubles are not so numerous as mine."

▪ Like governs nouns and pronouns; before phrases and clauses the equivalent word is as. We spent the evening like in the old days. We spent the evening as in the old days.

▪ Nauseous. Nauseated. The first means "sickening to contemplate"; the second means "sick at the stomach." Do not, therefore, say, "I feel nauseous,"

▪ She headquarters in Newark. She has headquarters in Newark. The theater troupe debuted last fall. The theatre troupe made its debut last fall.

▪ One. In the sense of "a person," not to be followed by his or her. One must watch his step. One must watch one's step.

▪ Partially. Not always interchangeable with partly. Best used in the sense of "to a certain degree," when speaking of a condition or state: "I'm partially resigned to it." Partly carries the idea of a part as distinct from the whole — usually a physical object.

▪ Partially. Not always interchangeable with partly. Best used in the sense of "to a certain degree," when speaking of a condition or state: "I'm partially resigned to it." Partly carries the idea of a part as distinct from the whole — usually a physical object. The log was partially submerged. The log was partly submerged.

▪ The formula to express the speaker's belief regarding a future action or state is I shall; I will expresses determination or consent.

▪ Personally. Often unnecessary. Personally, I thought it was a good book. I thought it a good book.

▪ The mile run and the two-mile run were won by Jones and Cummings respectively. The mile run was won by Jones, the two-mile run by Cummings.

▪ I'm probably closer to my mother than my father. (Ambiguous.) I'm probably closer to my mother than to my father. I'm probably closer to my mother than my father is.

▪ That. Which. That is the defining, or restrictive, pronoun, which the nondefining, or nonrestrictive. (See Rule 3.) The lawn mower that is broken is in the garage. (Tells which one.) The lawn mower, which is broken, is in the garage. (Adds a fact about the only mower in question.)

▪ Substitute the second person for the third person. The writer must address his readers' concerns. As a writer, you must address your readers' concerns.

▪ Rather, very, little, pretty — these are the leeches that infest the pond of prose, sucking the blood of words. The constant use of the adjective little (except to indicate size) is particularly debilitating;

▪ The breezy style is often the work of an egocentric, the person who imagines that everything that comes to mind is of general interest and that uninhibited prose creates high spirits and carries the day

▪ It is seldom advisable to tell all. Be sparing, for instance, in the use of adverbs after "he said," "she replied," and the like: "he said consolingly"; "she replied grumblingly." Let the conversation itself disclose the speaker's manner or condition.
